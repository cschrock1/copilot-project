# Reflection

## What I Built
For this project, I created a **To-Do List website** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as complete. My goal was to practice working with JavaScript and DOM manipulation while creating something useful.

## What I Learned
- How to **manipulate the DOM** with JavaScript (adding/removing tasks).
- The importance of **clean and responsive design** with CSS.
- How to use **Git and GitHub** to save and share my code.
- Why writing a good `README.md` helps explain projects to others.

---

## Challenges I Faced
- Getting the JavaScript functions to update the task list correctly.
- Understanding how to link my project files together (HTML, CSS, JS).
- Learning the steps of pushing changes to GitHub.

## What I Would Improve
If I had more time, I would:
- Add **local storage** so tasks remain after refreshing the page.
- Create a **dark mode toggle** for better design.
- Add due dates, categories, or drag-and-drop reordering for tasks.

## Overall Reflection
This project helped me understand the workflow of creating a small web app from scratch and pushing it to GitHub. I also learned the importance of planning features before coding. Overall, I feel more confident in my web development skills after completing this.
