# Reflection

## What did you ask Copilot to help you build? How did you break down the problem?
I asked Copilot to help me build a **To-Do List website**. At first, I started with the basics: setting up the HTML structure and styling with CSS. Then I broke the problem into smaller steps:
- Create the input box and button for adding tasks.
- Write JavaScript to add new tasks to the list.
- Add functionality to mark tasks as complete or delete them.
- Style the layout to make it look clean and simple.

## How did your approach to asking questions change as you worked?
At the beginning, I asked very general questions like “how do I make a to-do list with JavaScript?” As I worked, I got more specific and asked targeted questions such as:
- How do I delete a task when I click the button?
- How can I mark a task as complete by changing its style?
- What else could I add to make the app better?

This showed me that breaking things down into small, focused questions was much more effective than asking broad ones.

## What parts of the development process with GitHub Copilot surprised you?
I was surprised by how helpful Copilot was with **filling in repetitive code** and suggesting improvements I hadn’t thought of. For example, it suggested ways to make the delete function cleaner. I was also surprised that Copilot could help with **non-code parts** like writing my README and reflection, which made the project feel more complete.

## What did you learn about the technology you used that you didn't know before?
I learned how **JavaScript manipulates the DOM** (adding/removing HTML elements dynamically). I also learned how GitHub works for saving and sharing projects:
- How to initialize a repo.
- How to commit and push changes.
- How the `README.md` helps explain the project.

## What would you do differently if you had to build this again?
If I built this again, I would:
- Add **local storage** so tasks save after refreshing.
- Spend more time planning features before coding.
- Ask even more precise questions to Copilot early on to save time.
- Explore advanced features like due dates, categories, or drag-and-drop sorting.

## Overall Reflection
This project taught me how to take an idea, break it into steps, and use Copilot to support me along the way. I also grew more confident using GitHub to manage my code and document my work.
